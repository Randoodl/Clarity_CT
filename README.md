### ‚ùìAbout <a name = "about"></a>
Clarity CT is a simple, customisable RGB colour picker and palette tool intended to be used alongside graphic design applications.  
Its whole purpose is to provide you with an easily copyable colour value in either RGB or HEX notation.  
It started as a small, fun foray into raylib and turned into the behemoth it is now.

It is not, and it is not meant to be. This is quite literally just a pet project duct taped together by a hobbyist that grew way beyond the scope it was supposed to have. If you want to have a peek under the hood, that's on you.


### üõ†Ô∏è Features <a name = "features"></a>
- **Interactive Colour Picker:** - Select a specific hue using the colour dial and narrow down its shade using the shader square.
- **Display related colours:** - Automatically generate complement and triadic colours, alongside shades and tints thereof.
- **Copyable HEX and RGB values:** - Easily copy colour values for use in other applications with but a single click.
- **Custom UI:** - Scale and move elements to create a comfortable layout in an optional Dark Mode.

### ‚ùì Answers to questions nobody asked <a name = "faq"></a>
* `Why?`  
    * Because, while messing around with RGB channels in python, I came up with what has got to be the worst way to whip up 1530 different RGB hue tuples.  
    I decided to try and do the same in C++, but while I was at it I figured I might as well add some extra nonsense, you know, for a laugh.  
    Somewhere along the way it went from 'a laugh' to an actual program (*though this statement is still up for debate*).

* `No HSL?`  
    * Nope.  
    This project grew way beyond the joke it was supposed to be. RGB and HEX is all you get.

* `I think the icons are terrible, can I change those?`
    * First off, ouch.  
    But secondly: yes you can! (Though only during compilation.)  
    The icons are stored as dumb strings in the daringly named [IconStrings.h](./include/IconString.h).  
    You don't even have to confine yourself to the 16x16 grid: anything goes as long as you make it square.
    There's a [quick and dirty python script](./tools/Icons.py) to turn simple transparent .pngs into icons strings, if you fancy.

* `I don't like the look of that EmbeddedFont.h`
    * That's not a question, but also: good!  
    You probably shouldn't be trusting a [huge pile of hexadecimals](./include/EmbeddedFont.h) provided by a stranger on the internet, anyway. If you'd rather compile your own font there's a handy-dandy [raylib font exporter](./tools/RaylibConvertFont.cpp) tidbit so you can make your own EmbeddedFont.h at your leisure.

* `Can I use thi-`
    * Yes.  
    If you somehow managed to find an actual use case  for any of this you are free to use any or all parts of Clarity CT for any purpose.  
    I'd appreciate a nod if you did, though.

* `Clarity CT?`
    * The *C* in 'CT' stands for 'fun'
